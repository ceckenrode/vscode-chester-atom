### Contributing

If you have an improvement, feel free to submit a [pull request](https://github.com/ceckenrode/vscode-chester-atom) along with a screenshot of how the change will affect syntax coloring.

I personally develop primarily HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So I very much welcome PR's that improve usability with other languages.
